## Project Title
Green Innovation and CO2 Emissions: A VECM Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between green innovation, CO2 emissions, and other relevant factors such as energy prices, GDP per capita, and industrial production. We used a Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to estimate the long-run and short-run relationships between these variables. The project also includes a Granger causality test to examine the causal relationships between the variables.

## Data
The data used in this project are sourced from various publicly available databases, including the World Bank and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The dataset covers the period from 1990 to 2018 for a sample of 20 countries.

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using R, with various packages such as vars, ggplot2, and lmtest. The code and analysis are presented in an R Markdown document.

## Results
The results of the VECM analysis indicate a significant long-run relationship between CO2 emissions, green patents, GDP per capita, industrial production, and energy prices. The Granger causality test shows that there is a unidirectional causality from energy prices to green patents and CO2 emissions.

## Limitations and Future Research
The limitations of this study include the assumption of linearity between the variables and the assumption of stationarity. Future research could explore potential non-linearities in the relationship between variables and develop more advanced models that account for non-stationarity. Additionally, using more granular data could provide more accurate estimates of the relationships between variables.
